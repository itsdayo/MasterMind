     <p><b>The Rules of MasterMind</b></p>
  	
  	  MasterMind is a two player game or a game played against the computer. We have one player as the codemaker trying to create a difficult combination of 4 colors, duplicates allowed, so that the second player, 
  	  the codebreaker will have trouble guessing the pattern. After each guess the codebreaker makes they're color coded pegs that grades each guess. Red represents a color in the correct spot
      White represents a color used correctly but not in the correct spot and black represent a color not used.	
    
    <!--<p><b>The Buttons</b></p>
    <ul>	
  	  <li>
  	    <b>CLICK</b> the Mushroom <img src="images/backbutton.png" alt="Mushroom" width="30" height="38"> to take back a move.	
  	  </li>

  	    <b>CLICK</b> the Robot Arm <img src="images/robot arm.png" alt="Robot" width="30" height="38"> on the top of the board
  		   to play against the Computer in the beginning of the game. Then <b>CLICK</b> the Robot Arm <img src="images/robot arm.png" alt="Robot" width="30" height="38">
  	       on the bottom right of the board for the computer's move.

   <li> <p>
   	The modern game with pegs was invented by a man named Mordecai Meirowitz, a telecommunications expert. 
   	It resembles a similar an earlier game called Bulls and Cows. 
   	    </p>
   	</li>
   
   <li><p>Many mathematicias play and try to create what is called a Five Guess algorithm, which is an algorithm that will crack
   	any code in a number a alittle less than 5.  
   	   </p>
   </li>
  </ul>

<div id="tabs-3">
<ul>
<li>David Knuth showed that his codebreaking algorithm can solve anyones code in 5 turns or fewer by decreasing the numbr of possible patterns.
</li>
<li>Create a set of the number of possibilites, there are 1296 in the beginning. The first guess most be an aabb which means to colors being duplicated and next to each other.</li> 
<li>
Remove all the combinations that will not give you a better peg score in the set of the number of possibilities.</li> 	
<li>After each guess calculate the amount of possiblities you can have less and use the guess that will give you the the greater peg score.
</li>
<li>Go back to step two until you break the code</li>

   <b>For the Children</b> 
   <ul>
     <li>With my game's funny and creative designs, young children will love playing a game that 
         will help them improve their problem solving and planning skills.
     </li> 
     <li>It also provides them with early practice with mental arithmetic.</li>
   </ul>
    <p><b>For the Average player</b>
    <ul>
	 <li>A very fast game for people transitioning from place to place.</li>
     <li> Good brain teaser to add to a morning schedule and wake the brain up before a long day.</li>
     <li>Helps the mind to stay on focus and prepared for what the day will bring.</li>
